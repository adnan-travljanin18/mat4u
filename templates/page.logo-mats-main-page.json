When determining whether logo door mats should be inside or outside, it is essential to consider the material they are made from. Certain materials are better suited for outdoor use, as they are designed to withstand weather conditions such as rain and sunlight. For example, rubber mats are durable and work well outside. On the other hand, water-absorbent materials may not hold up well to outdoor elements and can get damaged by rain. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use a water-resistant, durable mat outside and a water-absorbent one inside. This combination helps to protect floors from dirt and moisture while ensuring the longevity of the mats. Ultimately, the best practice is to have a doormat both inside and outside to create a barrier against dirt and moisture, keeping your interior clean and safe.<\/p>","opened":false}},"accordion_iCAHkm":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"question":"Made To Measure","answer":"<p>We offer made-to-measure custom logo mats in heavy-duty logo mats and coir logo mats.
